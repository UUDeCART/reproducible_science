### Course Description

In this 2.5 day course, participants will learn, discuss, and put into practice the basic principles of reproducibility. Topics we may cover include putting data management plans into practice, developing workflows, writing documentation, finding an ontology or metadata schema, and using existing software or resources that support open science. 

**Prerequisite**

Participants should have some familiarity with the research process.

**Learning Outcomes**

  * Understand challenges of reproducibility and related issues
  * Create a workflow that enables reproducible science
  * Identify the appropriate software/resource to meet research goals

## Acknowledgements

Many hours of conversations and research went into pulling this material together. In particular, I would like to thank Brian Chapman for the opportunity to teach this course and covering Docker in module 4; Daureen Nesdill for sharing her training materials on data management; Vicky Steeves for sharing resources on containers; Donna Ziegenfuss for support with course assessment; and the Eccles Library staff for their moral support. Special thanks to Melissa Rethlefsen and Mellanye Lackey for their general support of this endeavor. 

Thanks to the participants for being present, motivated, and engaged in their own learning experience -- you made the course so enjoyable to teach.

Most importantly, I would not have survived this experience without my loving and supportive husband, Arjun Krishnan, who also acted as my sounding board, shared personal anecdotes about his research process, inspired some of the exercises, and contributed his notes for module 4. Thank you.
