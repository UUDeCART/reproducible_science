It does not include honest error or honest difference in interpretations or judgments of data.\n",
    "1. Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting the fabricated results.\n",
    "2. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.\n",
